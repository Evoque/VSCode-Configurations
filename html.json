	// Place your snippets for HTML here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Html Template": {
		"prefix": "html",
		"body": [
			"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset='UTF-8'>\n  <title></title>\n</head>\n\n<body>\n  ${0}\n</body>\n\n</html>"
		],
		"description": "Sample HTML template"
	},
	"strict": {
		"prefix": "evoStrict",
		"body": [
			"'use strict';"
		],
		"description": "Use Strict."
	}
